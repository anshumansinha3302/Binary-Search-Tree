# Binary-Search-Tree
The Binary Search Tree (BST) program in Java provides a structured approach to managing and searching data efficiently. A Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. In this program, each node contains an integer value, and the tree adheres to the BST property: for each node, all values in its left subtree are less, and all values in its right subtree are greater than the node's value. This structure allows efficient data operations, making it ideal for dynamic datasets that require frequent insertion, search, and in-order traversal to view data in sorted order.

The primary functionalities implemented in this program include inserting new nodes, searching for specific values, and displaying nodes in ascending order through in-order traversal. The insertion method takes an integer value, creates a new node if the tree is empty, or recursively places the value in the correct subtree based on comparison with existing nodes. The search method checks if a given value exists in the tree, leveraging the BST's inherent property to minimize the number of comparisons. It navigates left if the key is smaller than the current node's value and right if larger, providing an efficient O(log n) time complexity in average cases.

Additionally, the in-order traversal method provides a sorted sequence of stored values by recursively visiting the left subtree, the root, and then the right subtree. This function is useful for printing all tree elements in ascending order. The program structure includes an inner `Node` class representing individual elements, while the main `BinarySearchTree` class manages tree operations. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of insertion, search, and traversal, outputting results for verification. Overall, this BST program exemplifies a simple yet powerful way to manage ordered data, offering efficient operations for insertion, search, and sorted data retrieval.
